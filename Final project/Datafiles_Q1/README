There are several files here. The file file_info_for_problem.csv
contains the summary of the observations. It is a CSV file with 7
columns:
 
      ID: A running ID (unique) for each observation
 FieldID: The ID number of a particular field observed. Observations of
          the same field always have the same FieldID.
Filename: The name of the FITS file containing the image
  Filter: The filter used.
     MJD: The modified Julian date of the observations.
 Airmass: The mean airmass of the observations.
 Exptime: The exposure time of the image in seconds.


The image files are not included and you can assume that those are
stored in a known location so that only the filename is required to
keep (this is of course an oversimplification but sufficient for our
needs here).

For each image there is a corresponding catalogue file with the format
given in the problem set and repeated below. The catalogue is named
Filed-<FieldID>-<Filter>.fits for Z, Y, J, and H. Since the Ks band
can be observed multiple times, it has file names
Field-<FieldID>-Ks-E<epoch>.fits, where the epoch is a counter o the
number of observations of the field ordered chronologically. Thus the
first observation is E001, the second E002 etc.

The catalogues are matched so that row 1 is the same object in all
catalogues of the same field (this is a big simplification relative to
a real situation).
